            <p>The newspaper headline was originally introduced as a sight gag in a scene from "The Old Man and the Key,"<br> Episode 13, Season 13 of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons originally aired on March 10th, 2002. In the episode, Abe, the father of the protagonist character Homer Simpson, pays a visit to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to get his driver's license issued and convinces his co-in-law Patty Bouvier to use a photograph of him that was once featured in a local newspaper in lieu of an official license photograph on the spot. <br>Upon obtaining his newly issued driver's license, Abe walks over to a window and yells "who's laughing now?" at a cloud while holding the card in his hand.            
            The first known wordplay on Abe Simpson's image can be traced to a humorous commentary on cloud computing technology posted by mobile tech blogger Joey deVilla on September 30th, 2008.
